# Getting Started

If you are not sure where to start, consider the advice from the Gang of Four: 

> If you aren't an experience object oriented designed, 
> then start with the simplest and most common patterns. (Gamma et al, 1994)

These are those simplest and most common patterns:

* Abstract Factory
* Adapter
* Composite
* Decorator
* Factory Method
* Observer
* Strategy 
* Template Method
